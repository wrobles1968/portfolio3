        <h2>So What About Me</h2>
        My first love was marketing! One day I met graphic design,  that was my soul mate.(two timer!!)</p>

            <p>I originally graduated from California State University Los Angeles with degrees in Political Science and Business/Marketing with an emphasis in advertising. In the working world I found I had a knack for designing. It started with front end web site design which open up the door to being senior graphic designer and lead designer. I eventually I got my Art and Design degree and from that point on, it was experience, experience, experience!</p>
            <p> Philosophy</p>
              <p>While graphic design is my true love, I never forget that there is a business side to it. ..Yes the real world. My marketing background will look at consumer behavior, what communication vehicle works. In other words as a graphic artist I can think outside the box while my marketing side keeps in perspective.</p>
